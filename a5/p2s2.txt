There was a bug in the list.c file - in the line 69 and the line 70 where e was being freed in list_delete_element. Tree_delete_element the e in the tree was producing a dangling point due to it being freed. These problems were fixed, and the memory leaks were eliminated. We added an int field to the struct element, which counted the refs and we added helper functions which were declared in the header file "element_inc_ref" & "element_dec_ref." these manipulate the ref int field in the struct and free the object when appropriate.
