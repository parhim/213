Observation:
tRead runtime grows substantially when compared to aRead - therefore, this basically means that tRead is slower than aRead 

Explanations: 
Because tRead uses multiple threads - and blocking/unblocking, causes CPU to go between threads. When a change to another thread is needed, the current one needs to be saved on stack - which then forces tRead to take more time as the blocks continue to increase. Therefore, resulting in the processing of threads for tRead to take more time and be slower.
